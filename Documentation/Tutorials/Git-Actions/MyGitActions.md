# MyGitActions

# Description
This project is based on learning and GitHub Git Actions from a tutorial on youtube named "Github Actions CI/CD - Everything you need to know to get started" -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFFXuXjVgkU. 

This tutorial explains GitHub actions by giving an introduction to GitHub Actions, walkthrough of file workflow, hands on demo of creating Creating Repo and setting up Action with also Running and Troubleshooting workflows. These hands on practices did I apply by creating my own repository and following the demo by adding git acgtions to the project. 
Below is an Gif displaying using these hands on actions in my own repository.
