# My-Project-Git-Actions

This project is based on learning and using Git Actions from a tutorial on youtube named "GitHub Actions Tutorial - Basic Concepts and CI/CD Pipeline with Docker" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8_veQiYBjI. 

The tutorial explains what Github Actions are and gives a demo with using a java application. Personally, I did not find the tutorial helpful due to the fact that she did not 
explain clearly and was missing steps as in building a docker file while it clearly needs to be exaplained. There are other watchers that had the same issue with me where the
tutorial did not work when it came to the hands on parts.

Below is an Gif displaying using these hands on actions in my own repository.
