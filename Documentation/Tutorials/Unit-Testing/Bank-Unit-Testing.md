# Bank Unit Testing

This project is based on learning Unit Testing in C# from a tutorial on youtube named "C# Unit Tests Using NUnit (.NET) (Beginner)" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvqAGchg8bc&t=3s

This tutorial explains how to create unit test with the concept (Arrange, Act, Assert) with very basic functions. It gave me the core concept on how to think and program regarding unit testing with using functionalities of a bank application and creating unit tests on these functionalities.
