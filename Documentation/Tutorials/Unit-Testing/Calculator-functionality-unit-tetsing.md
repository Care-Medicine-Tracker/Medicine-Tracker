# Calculator Unit Testing

This project is based on applying the knowledge I have learned from the tutorial on youtube named "C# Unit Tests Using NUnit (.NET) (Beginner)" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvqAGchg8bc&t=3s on how to set up unit testing in C#.

This tutorial explains how to create unit test with the concept (Arrange, Act, Assert) with very basic functions. It gave me the core concept on how to think and program regarding unit testing with using functionalities of a bank application and creating unit tests on these functionalities.
From the knowledge I acquired, I created unit tests for functions based on a calculator functions to apply what I have learned from this tutorial.
